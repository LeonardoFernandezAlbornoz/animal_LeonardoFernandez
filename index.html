    <h1 id="top">THE EMPEROR PENGUIN</h1>
    
    <h2>Features and characteristics</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Scientific name: <em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em></li>
        <li>Genus: <em>Aptenodytes</em></li>
        <li>Family: <em>Spheniscidae</em></li>
        <li>Order: <em>Sphenisciformes</em></li>
        <li>Class: <em>Aves</em></li>

        <li>Kingdom: <em>Animalia</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <strong>emperor penguin</strong>, whose scientific name is Aptenodytes forsteri, belongs<br>
        to the family Spheniscidae and is classified as a species  of sphenisciform bird, that is, it <br>
        is part of the flightless seabirds that inhabit only the southern hemisphere.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Description of the emperor penguin</h2>

    <ol type="I">
        <li>Height: Between 120 and 140 centimeters</li>
        <li>Weight: around 40kg</li>
        <li>Habitat: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" target="_blank">Antartica</a> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This species can reach a height of up to 1.22 meters, which makes it the largest and <br>
        heaviest penguin, unlike the other penguins. Their weight varies from 22 to 45 kg, the <br>
        males being heavier.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The body of these birds, like other penguin species, is adapted to regulate their temperature to <br>
        environmental conditions and their hydrodynamic shape allows them to minimize water resistance <br>
        when in contact with water. Their rigid, flat wings are as strong as flippers, allowing them to <br>
        move easily through the Antarctic seas.  They have 15 feathers per square  centimeter, making them<br>
        the birds with the largest amount of plumage.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Feeding and predators </h2>
    <p>
        Basically the diet of the emperor penguin consists of fish, crustaceans such as krill and cephalopods<br>
        such as octopus and squid, but mainly the so-called Antarctic Devil (type of fish) occupies the largest <br>
        percentage in the diet of this species.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The tongue of the emperors contains barbs directed backwards so that their prey cannot escape easily. <br>
        They mostly search for prey in the open sea of the Antarctic Ocean or in crevices that form in the <br>
        ice shelves.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        It is the only penguin species that can dive for up to eighteen minutes and to a depth of 500 meters. Thanks<br>
        to the hemoglobin generated by its organism, it is able to accomplish the arduous task of searching for food <br>
        at such depths. They also have solid bones to reduce the pressure between their body and the water, as well <br>
        as the ability to slow down their metabolism and pause organ functions that are not necessary at that moment.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Among their predators, which mainly hunt chicks, are the giant Antarctic petrel and the polar skua. Adult <br>
        penguins are preyed upon by killer whales and leopard seals<br>
    </p>
