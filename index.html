    <p>
        The body of these birds, like other penguin species, is adapted to regulate their temperature 
        to environmental conditions and their <br> hydrodynamic shape allows them to minimize water 
        resistance when in contact with water. Their rigid, flat wings are as strong as flippers, 
        allowing them to move easily through the Antarctic seas.  They have 15 feathers per square 
        centimeter, making them the birds with the largest amount of plumage.
